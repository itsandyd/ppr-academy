## 📈 ITERATION STRATEGY

### **After First Post:**

**If it performs well (1000+ views):**
- Create similar intro videos with different hooks
- Test different music
- Try different opening problems
- A/B test captions

**If it underperforms (<500 views):**
- Recut with stronger hook (first 3 seconds)
- Try without voiceover (text only)
- Test different posting time
- Shorten to 21-25 seconds

### **Content Variations to Test:**

1. **Hook Variations:**
   - "Stop using 5 platforms to run your music business"
   - "This is what every producer is switching to in 2025"
   - "Your music business deserves better than this"

2. **Problem Variations:**
   - Show actual failed sales/missed bookings
   - Show bank account fees from multiple platforms
   - Show time wasted managing multiple dashboards

3. **Solution Variations:**
   - Start with dashboard, then explain
   - Show transformation before/after side-by-side
