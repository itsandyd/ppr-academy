# 🧑 Human-First AI Copywriting

## Philosophy

Our AI generates copy that sounds like **real humans**, not marketing robots. The goal is authentic, conversational content that builds trust—not hype-filled sales speak.

---

## 🎯 The Difference

### ❌ AI-Sounding (What We Avoid)

```
Title: "🎉 Unlock Transformative Learning Opportunities!"
Message: "Embark on your journey to excellence with our newly released, 
game-changing content! Don't miss this revolutionary opportunity to 
transform your skills and unlock unlimited potential! 🚀✨🎯"

Email Subject: "Your Success Journey Just Got Better! 🌟"
```

**Problems:**
- Too many emojis
- Vague buzzwords ("transformative", "revolutionary")
- Corporate speak
- Fake urgency
- No specific information
- Sounds like spam

### ✅ Human-Sounding (What We Generate)

```
Title: "Added 2 new modules on compression"
Message: "Just wrapped up 2 new modules covering parallel compression 
and sidechain techniques. Some of my best teaching yet. They're live 
now if you want to check them out."

Email Subject: "New compression modules just dropped"
```

**Why it works:**
- Conversational tone
- Specific details
- Natural language
- Genuine excitement
- Like a text from a friend
- Trustworthy

## 📝 Writing Principles

### 1. **Talk, Don't Market**

**❌ Marketing speak:**
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Transform your journey"
- "Game-changing techniques"
- "Revolutionary approach"

**✅ Real human talk:**
- "I'll show you how I do it"
- "You'll learn the exact process"
- "This is how I approach..."
- "Same techniques I use daily"

### 2. **Be Specific, Not Vague**

**❌ Vague:**
- "Master advanced techniques"
- "Learn industry secrets"
- "Become a professional"

**✅ Specific:**
- "Learn surgical EQ to fix frequency masking"
- "3-step process for tight 808 bass"
- "How to mix vocals that sit in the mix"

### 3. **Show, Don't Tell**

**❌ Telling:**
- "This course will change your life"
- "You'll become an expert"
- "Guaranteed results"

**✅ Showing:**
- "By the end, you'll mix tracks that translate across speakers"
- "You'll have a repeatable mixing workflow"
- "You'll know exactly when to use compression vs EQ"

### 4. **Use Natural Transitions**

**❌ Corporate:**
- "Furthermore..."
- "In addition..."
- "Moreover..."

**✅ Conversational:**
- "Plus..."
- "Also..."
- "And..."
- "Oh, and..."

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### System Prompt Strategy

**Old approach:**
```
"You are an expert copywriter..."
"Create compelling, benefit-driven copy..."
"Optimize for conversion..."
```

**New approach:**
```
"You're a course creator talking directly to your students..."
"Write like you're texting a friend..."
"Be casual, genuine, and specific..."
```

### Examples in Prompts

**Critical addition:**
```
Examples of GOOD human writing:
- "Just wrapped up 2 new modules..."
- "Added the thing you guys asked for..."

Examples of BAD AI writing:
- "Unlock transformative opportunities..."
- "Don't miss this game-changing..."
```

This trains the AI by showing explicit examples of what to do and not do.

### Temperature Settings

```typescript
// Before
temperature: 0.7  // Conservative, predictable

// After
temperature: 0.9  // More varied, natural, human-like
```

**Why higher temperature?**
- More variation in word choice
- Less formulaic
- More natural flow
- Less "AI pattern" repetition

## 💡 Creator Customization

### Edit Mode

After AI generates copy, creators should:

1. **Read it out loud** - Does it sound like you talking?
2. **Check for buzzwords** - Remove any marketing fluff
3. **Add personality** - Inject your voice
4. **Be more specific** - Replace vague with concrete
5. **Simplify** - Shorter sentences, simpler words

### Example Edit

**Generated:**
```
"This comprehensive course will empower you to develop professional-
level mixing capabilities through systematic skill development."
```

**After editing:**
```
"You'll learn how to mix like a pro, step by step."
```

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Use contractions**: "I'll" not "I will", "you're" not "you are"
- **Start sentences with And/But**: Natural in conversation
- **Use short sentences**: Mix it up—some long, mostly short
- **Be conversational**: "Hey", "So", "Basically"
- **Show enthusiasm naturally**: "Pretty excited about this one"
- **Use real examples**: "Like when you're mixing kick and bass"

### Don'ts ❌

- **Marketing clichés**: "Unlock", "Transform", "Game-changing"
- **Excessive punctuation**: "!!!" or "???"
- **Emoji overload**: Max 1-2, or none
- **Vague promises**: "Achieve greatness"
- **Fake scarcity**: "Limited time only!" (unless true)
- **Corporate tone**: "We are pleased to announce"
